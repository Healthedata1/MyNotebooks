#### Mandatory Search Parameters:

The following search parameters, search parameter combinations SHALL be supported.  Any listed search parameter [modifiers], [comparators], [chains] and [composites] SHALL also be supported UNLESS they are listed as "optional" in which case they SHOULD be supported.:

1. **SHALL** support searching using the combination of the **[`patient`](SearchParameter-us-core-careteam-patient.html)** and **[`status`](SearchParameter-us-core-careteam-status.html)** search parameters:
    - including support for composite *OR* search on `status` (e.g.`status={[system]}|[code],{[system]}|[code],...`)

    `GET [base]/CareTeam?patient=[reference]&status=active`

    Example:
    
      1. GET [base]/CareTeam?patient=1137192&amp;status=active

    *Implementation Notes:* Fetches a bundle of all CareTeam resources for the specified patient and status =`active` ([how to search by reference] and [how to search by token])
