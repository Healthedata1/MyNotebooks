These tables show the differences stacked side by side. The resulting columns will have multilevel labels with the ElementDefinition fields at the outer level and with "self" = Argonaut Data Query and "other" = US Core 5.0.0 stacked alternately at the inner level.

- The *Argonaut MedicationStatement Profile* and *Argonaut CarePlan Profile* have no equivalent US Core 5.0.0 Profile Type and are not mapped:
